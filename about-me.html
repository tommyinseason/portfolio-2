      <p>Welcome to a little page about my life in computer coding. My name is Tommy Jones, I am 30years old & this week I started at a coding bootcamp. The program is called "Epicodus", a computer coding school in the downtown Portland area. My experience with coding was little to none before starting school. Already after the first week im building web sites with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.</p>
      <p>I moved here from Las Vegas, NV about two weeks ago. I just left my position as a sales rep manager for Worldcrawl Las Vegas & Miami.  My goal attending Epicodus is to learn the skill set of a coder and apply this to my career and personal life, by both landing a job in programming and building my own personal web & app based business ideas.</p>
      <p>My professional experience is mostly in sales and marketing. I'm a college graduate & liscensed real estate agent.  My specialty is in the nightclub industry in Las Vegas & Miami. Adding coding into my skill set will not only give me a path to a new career in Portland, but also will give me the opportunity to create a few of my own business ideas as well. I plan to work a 9-5 as a programmer somewhere in the Portland area following school for the first couple years. In the future once my skill set has been mastered I plan to work remotey while I travel. In addition I have a few side projects that I will be building with my new found knowledge. Please check my page out click all the links and leave any feedack to me directly through the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.
